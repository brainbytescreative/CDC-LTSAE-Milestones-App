60 Month: Tip: Create a calm, quiet bedtime routine. Avoid any screen time (TV, tablets, phones, etc.) for 1 to 2 hours before bed and don't put any screens in your child’s bedroom. Children this age need 10 to 13 hours of sleep a day (including naps). Consistent sleep times make it easier!
60 Month: Tip: Eat meals with your child and enjoy family time talking together. Give the same meal to everyone. Avoid screen time (TV, tablets, phones, etc.) during mealtime. Let your child help prepare the healthy foods and enjoy them together.
60 Month: Tip: Create a spot in your home for your child to go to when he/she's upset. Stay nearby so your child knows he/she is safe and can come to you for help calming as needed.
60 Month: Tip: Encourage your child to “read” by looking at the pictures and telling the story.
60 Month: Tip: Encourage your child to pretend play. Help your child find items he/she can use to play dress up, school, or house.
60 Month: Tip: Keep a box of crayons, paper, paint, child scissors, and glue for creative play. Encourage your child to draw and make art projects with different supplies.
60 Month: Tip: Take your child to the playground. Teach him/her how to pump his/her legs back and forth on a swing and help her play on the monkey bars.
60 Month: Tip: Play games that help with memory and attention. For example, play card games, Tic Tac Toe, I Spy, or Hot and Cold.
60 Month: Tip: Read to your child. Ask questions, such as "What is happening in the picture?" and "What do you think will happen next?"
60 Month: Tip: Explore things your child likes. For example, if he/she loves animals, get some library books about animals, look for birds and squirrels in a park, or visit a zoo to learn about animals.
60 Month: Tip: Try to make time for active play each day. Your child will have more fun if he/she can choose the activity. For example, give him/her choices, such as playing music and dancing together, playing outside, or taking a walk together.
60 Month: Tip: Your child might start to talk back or use profanity (swear words) as a way to feel independent. Do not give a lot of attention to this talk, other than a brief time out. Instead, praise your child when he/she asks for things nicely and calmly takes “no” for an answer.
60 Month: Tip: Help your child be ready for new places and meeting new people. For example, you can read stories or role play (pretend play) to help him/her get ready for Kindergarten.`;
